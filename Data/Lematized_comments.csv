7/9/2015 15:06,559e4a49a9a36e729100146f,4,O, dear ryan allow elaborate way assume two model model 1 predicts speed athlete base height athlete meter distance meter track attempt.Model 2 predicts heartbeat athlete base diameter meter artery.Apparently RMSE/MAD model 1 large model 2 order thousand ten thousand.One way compare `` apple-to-apple '' suppose `` normalise '' predictor divide measurement mean standard e.g mean height athlete model one mean diameter artery model 2 able compare `` like-to-like '' i.e model result small RMSE/MAD .Trust clarify enquiry
7/10/2015 12:27,559e4a49a9a36e729100146f,5,O, oh get thanks clarifying.Folks seldom one totally could ... 's common compare model different variable term correlation interpretation 's similar anyways rmse vary overall scale variance data etc start think term proportion variance 's natural use metric design e.g correlation
7/13/2015 5:27,559e4a49a9a36e729100146f,6,O, point take ryan note thanks.You neatly point deficiency use RMSE/MAD benchmark models.One excitement get course use tool rapidminder build model 's rather benchmark model conducive circumstance subject question.Cheers

7/23/2015 18:37,55b00207a9a36ea584001df2,7,O, model skill completely independent n't really make sense get overall value across skill parameter.Think way 2 skill skill able add two 1 digit number example 1 2 3 skill b able determine whether variable continuous binominal two skill completely independent would n't make sense compute one overall initial knowledge one overall learn rate etc
7/23/2015 18:44,55b00207a9a36ea584001df2,8,B, alternatively people want modify code might possible simply separate data file two run code twice careful though 1 n't test make sure give result n't see reason would n't 2 sure separate data skill across different file row associate skill remain file
7/24/2015 14:05,55b00207a9a36ea584001df2,9,B, think would independent model well base think question 10 might need little specific ask p g VALUING-CAT-FEATURES skill instead one specific skill e.g META-VALUING-CAT-FEATURES1 make sense
7/25/2015 23:14,55b00207a9a36ea584001df2,10,O, hi bob VALUING-CAT-FEATURES skill set skills.The item column represent individual item well ... actually represent problem step true item would problem plus `` item '' n't problem data set build bkt code fit VALUING-CAT-FEATURES skill column META-VALUING-CAT-FEATURES1 problem step call `` item '' somewhat inaccurately fit item make sense paradigm like PFA.I hope clarifies let 's discuss

8/8/2015 6:05,55c50a07a9a36e3237002c3e,4,O, yes p affect.concentrating=1 would appear logical include observation precede behavior.ontask value would exclude first observation student would similar p behavior.ontask =1 include last observation.It would appear value calculate confidence may thus `` accidentally '' correct since calculation lift question 10 base calculated value confidence p affect.concentrating =1 use previous value give incorrect answer.I try re-calculate p affect.concentrating=1 without precede observation work either

8/10/2015 20:31,55c65318b30d84b8bb002bdd,3,O, hi agree 's interesting problem may find useful look dekker et al 2009 pechenizkiy 's work since ca n't remember top head look google scholar cite paper.I think logistic regression reasonable choice give sparsity data set presence lot binary realize include many time student take course 's mostly binary support vector machine might work pretty well usually n't recommend problem maybe ... J48 might overfit 's worth try general n't think hurt try thing 500 thing would risk overfitting 70/30 split reasonable would recommend cross-validation strongly use data systematically likely estimate eventual later performance well
