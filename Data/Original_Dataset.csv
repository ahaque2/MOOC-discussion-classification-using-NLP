7/1/2015 19:40,5594422ca9a36ea584000dc2,BQ,Hi. \n\nI am very new to big data and specifically to this program - Rapid Miner. Are we supposed to download it? Or are we using somehow inside the Edx course? \n\nAlso - if I have never used Rapid Miner - does that mean this is the wrong course for me? \n\nThanks\nLizzie
7/1/2015 19:48,5594422ca9a36ea584000dc2,BQ,"In the first lecture, Prof Baker says we ""may want to think about downloading or setting up accounts for tools like RapidMiner 5.3, that's probably going to be our biggest tool in the course.""  It appears to be available at https://rapidminer.com/ , where you can download it (or perhaps use it online?)."
7/1/2015 19:56,5594422ca9a36ea584000dc2,B,...although what's available there is RapidMiner 6 rather than 5.3.  I assume that'll be ok.  On the upside: it's available for Linux as well as Windows and Mac! :)  On the possibly-down-side: the trial license is only good for two weeks.  What happens at the end of that?
7/1/2015 20:17,5594422ca9a36ea584000dc2,B,I did see in the walkthrough document a link to download a previous version which then appears to be free - although I have not done this yet. I am trying to get my bearing so far to see if this course might be completely too advanced for me :)
7/2/2015 8:54,5594422ca9a36ea584000dc2,B,"Hi all. I expect most people taking this class will NOT have used RapidMiner before. We have a Walkthrough and also Primer Resources to help you get started. It's not that hard a tool to use; a bit of startup effort but once you get going it's definitely doable. Feel free to post questions and confusions to the forum. (And yes, please go to the link in the Walkthrough to download the appropriate version).\n\nWelcome to the class!"

7/3/2015 15:07,5594422ca9a36ea584000dc2,B,"Hi -- as mentioned in other threads BTW, you probably want to use 5.3 rather than 6. 6 is not guaranteed to obtain exactly the same results, although it probably will. (But when it doesn't, the results may be frustrating :-)"
7/7/2015 5:59,5594422ca9a36ea584000dc2,BQ,"I have downloaded and installed Rapid Miner and the Weke component as stated in the RapidMiner Walthrough.

7/8/2015 13:11,5594422ca9a36ea584000dc2,B,"Hi Adora. I admit, I'm downright baffled. Maybe go through the Read CSV wizard again from beginning to the last window and then click Finish there, and then redo the Set Role operator?\n\nSorry I don't have better ideas. I think there was another thread about editing the xml directly, perhaps that will work?"
7/1/2015 20:00,559446cab30d847c6f000d5f,BQ,"Hi, I just want to ask, where it is possible to download rapidminer and which version to download 6 or 5.3?\nthanks"
7/1/2015 20:18,559446cab30d847c6f000d5f,B,Look under week 1 - activity for a file download of rapid miner walkthrough. There I think it specifies which to download and where you can get it.
7/1/2015 20:25,559446cab30d847c6f000d5f,B,"Hi, looking at the primer video, they use version 6, altough they say they'd show how it looks when the 5.3 is different."
7/2/2015 5:21,559446cab30d847c6f000d5f,B,"It may help some of you who are struggling with the ""readme . txt"" within the rapidminer folder:\n\n- once you download the zip (if you're on a Mac, like I am), if you cannot open the programme using the recommended RapidMinerGUI, and opt for using the command line to open it by copying the command as written on the paper, please note that they refer to "". / script / RapidMinerGUI"" when in reality it should be "". / scripts / RapidMinerGUI"" and that the name of the directory might have been listed on the instructions as ""RapidMiner"" (the folder extracted from the downloaded zip, but it is actually written in all lower case as ""rapidminer"" \n\nIt can be frustrating if you don't examine the actual ""spelling"" of the commands. It took me a while to just calm down and make sure that the names are compatible - and also that they match my particular config.\n\nElemental perhaps, but it is often overlooked.\n\nPS - I purposely separated the commands "". name /"" so don't get confused even more.\n\nBest,"
7/2/2015 8:58,559446cab30d847c6f000d5f,B,"Please use 5.3 and go to the Walkthrough first.\n\nVersion 6 is similar to 5.3 in terms of GUI, so the Primers should still\nbe useful. \n\nThe main reason we use 5.3 is because A) it's fully open-source and 6 is not;\nB) the academic version of 6 has some restrictions;\nand C) I know what the bugs are in version 5.3. \n\n:-)\n\n(These limitations are not unique to RapidMiner; every large data mining and statistics package has bugs)"
7/3/2015 13:43,559446cab30d847c6f000d5f,BQ,Tell me what kind of error or Bug in the RapidMiner 5.3 (Free) Please? Thanks!!
7/3/2015 15:11,559446cab30d847c6f000d5f,B,"There are probably more than this, but to my knowledge the computation of AUC can be a bit over-optimistic (see alternate package on my webpage), and computation of Pearson correlation in regression models when using cross-validation can occasionally overestimate when some folds drop below a cross-validated correlation of 0. (So just be careful if your cross-validated correlation is right around 0, to look at the individual-fold values for correlation). I don't think either bug was fixed in 6, but the correlation bug is new since 4.6."

7/2/2015 5:43,5594cf98a9a36e4e4e000ddc,T,"Has any MOOC provider opened up their data for research purposes, or for a course like this one?

7/2/2015 6:40,5594cf98a9a36e4e4e000ddc,T,I think it is more likely that questionnaires provided by universities are the base. I doubt Coursera has ever shared anything with the public or with instructors.
7/2/2015 11:34,5594cf98a9a36e4e4e000ddc,T,Check out the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center DataShop.\nI think their data sets are still bigger than any MOOC provider's public data sets.

Launched a management consultancy, here in the UAE with focus on new school development. Working inside an educational organization over the past three years, I feel there is a lack of understanding how to identify and use the information compiled for learning, operations and development. I look forward to learning a method(s) that I can apply and execute in my business practice."

I successfully installed it on my Mac already.\n\nAs the course suggested learners to install RapidMiner 5.3 (which presumably is for MS Windows) and reasoned that assignments were written with version 5.3, would it be an issue if I used RapidMiner Studio for Mac (version 6.4.0) in this course?"
7/2/2015 9:33,559503baa9a36edf34000e2e,BQ,"As a follow on, I did the same and the trial licence changes to a standard licence after 14 days.

7/2/2015 14:16,559503baa9a36edf34000e2e,B,"Keith,\n\nIt appears to me that you are also using RapidMiner Studio for Mac OS X (version 6.4.0) in this learning venture.\n\nDo you know how to install ""WEKA Expansion Pack"" in RapidMiner Studio for Mac?  The instructions set out in the course materials appeared to be intended for Windows instead."
7/3/2015 0:57,559503baa9a36edf34000e2e,B,"Hi. I can't guarantee that you will get all of the same answers with 6.4 as you would get with 5.3; therefore, unless you want the assignments to be a frustrating experience you should probably go with 5.3.\n\n(If you're thinking ""how annoying!"" -- think about the difficulties we'd have if the correct answer on the assignment suddenly changed the 3rd day the assignment was out to students. The challenges of working with commercial tools!)"
7/4/2015 5:12,559503baa9a36edf34000e2e,B,"Dear Ryan,\n\nI am very much into your advice.\n\nAs part of my job, I have been travelling around together with my Macbook so that I opt to install RapidMiner Studio (v. 6.4.0) for Mac as advised by RapidMiner.\n\nI understand there would be differences (not substantial I suppose) from the course materials which focus on RapidMiner (v. 5.3) for Windows.  I encountered the first challenge when I tried to install the extension ""WEKA"".  Luckily the RapidMiner community is pretty supportive and I managed to get through after consulting the community.\n\nCopying buddy Keith, Ryan rightly pointed out that one way to achieve in this course is we wouldn't fail until we give up. . ."

Another thing to try if this does not work (because the Set Role looks right to me) is to make sure that the Read CSV wizard was run the whole way through.

7/2/2015 19:44,559594afa9a36e5e21000eb8,Q,"In regression, is there a preferred method for dealing with outliers in particular data sets or perhaps in identifying outliers?  In the past I have worked with data including test scores and test duration.  In some instances test duration was much lower than expected bringing into question the validity of the associated score.  Is it best to identify these and remove them from the data set prior to regression or can the regression be designed in a way that identifies the impact of these data points?\n\nThank you!"
7/2/2015 20:32,559594afa9a36e5e21000eb8,O,"Unless you know that an outlier is due to some measurement error, removing outliers from a data set is rarely a good idea.  For datasets with influential outliers the best approach is to use a technique called robust regression, which retains the outlier observation in the dataset but which reduces its weight when calculating the regression result."
7/3/2015 16:05,559594afa9a36e5e21000eb8,O,"I agree partially with you, gpurcell. I agree that outliers usually don't need to be deleted in big data situations, however when doing some types of feature engineering prior to building your models (week 3 I think), you sometimes want to think about thresholding extreme values or eliminating them, prior to unitizing variables, etc. \n\nThe other way I'm not sure if I agree is that removing some cases may be principled. For example, if you are interested in learning patterns among students who took the assignment seriously, using a model of gaming the system and a model of carelessness to first remove some students may help you focus on what you;'re interested in. The key is -- can you replicate what you did when you actually use your model -- and is it justified?"
7/6/2015 19:43,559594afa9a36e5e21000eb8,O,Thank you both for the response!  I will certainly study robust regression and look forward to the session on engineering prior to building models to determine in what instances removing outliers is warranted.

I right clicked, selected ""Replace Operator"", ""Batch X validation"".\n\nI thought I got it, but turned out I was not.  First, the panel on the right side didn't show the k-fold cross-validation option.  Secondly, once I moved to the Training and Testing screen, error message shown after I press Run.

7/4/2015 10:30,5595d563a9a36ebe32000e2d,B,"Hi, Colam. Actually, now that I think about it, Batch-X-Validation shouldn't have a k-fold option. The batches are the folds. Step 20 asks you to do regular X-Validation, not Batch-X-Validation (it just notes that in other cases you will want to use Batch-X-Validation). Sorry for the confusion.\n\nRegarding the file loading issue, I'm not sure what's causing it. I have not had that problem on any machine before. Maybe check RapidMiner forums? :-("

I have done what sounds like the same thing: added a ""NominalToNumerical"" block before the LogisticRegression one, using ""dummy coding"" for the Activity attribute. The rest of the chain is the same as the one that had been giving correct replies since question 4.  \n\nCould it have something to do with the kernel used by the Logistic Regression? I stayed with the default one (dot)."
7/3/2015 17:49,5595db2fb30d8482e6000e47,Q,tsg2 -- what's the exact error message you got?\n\nfolks who got 0. we had this last time we used the assignment too. i get the official answer. i'm not sure what causes this (but feel free to post your full processes so i can look). \n\ntalking a long time is normal for the process you're using.
7/3/2015 20:58,5595db2fb30d8482e6000e47,O,"I'm also getting 0.000 as the kappa score.  The model seems to be predicting Y for nearly everything, including over 9000 false positives, so that explains the low score, although I don't know why it's building that model, of course.\n\nI'm on Linux, running RM 5.3 via java.  Here's a screenshot of the process: ![process screenshot][1] \n\n\n  [1]: http://www.blahedo.org/tmp/ctat1-process.png"
7/4/2015 10:35,5595db2fb30d8482e6000e47,O,"Hi -- 0.000 is basically fine. It has to do with how you set up the variable types during the Read CSV step. (Did you keep Activity as binomial? Or set it to polynomial? And so on.) We set up the assignment during the last MOOC to also accept 0.000 but apparently that got removed due to human error. \n\nBottom line -- it's ok for this step to click through hints, type in the answer it gives, and move on to the next step."
7/4/2015 16:01,5595db2fb30d8482e6000e47,O,"I got the linear part right, I had something stupid wrong.  The log. error was that I had zero as the kappa.  I finally did give up and just click thru the hints and make sure it was set up right and entered the answer."
7/4/2015 19:16,5595db2fb30d8482e6000e47,O,"I had a similar issue with a ""data contains missing values"" message. Setting Activity to be a polynomial threw an error for Linear Regression. I changed Activity to numeric... but since it isn't actually numeric, the data came through as missing values. Or, I think that is what is happening. -- thoughts about how to fix this?"
7/5/2015 9:26,5595db2fb30d8482e6000e47,O,"I think that the Nominal-to-Numeric operator is what you need, EmilyK019"

Yes, I can import a CSV file and apply a model but without having looked at the data at all. In my opinion, it would have been better to describe what the data represents, i.e., what are the variables, etc. before applying a model that may undoubtedly be appropriate but does not give me any insight in the data itself."

Studying inter-relationships between variables for comprehension is typically relationship mining rather than prediction modeling, a later week of the course. And we will talk more about understanding what goes into a prediction model and the meaning of the features in week 3. So hang in there... you may find it more interesting in later weeks."

R is more like programming, I find all the icons in r-studio distracting, where with r you just type a line.  Edx is currently running a class analytics edge that uses R you might want to take a look at that, on coursera duke runs a class on stats that also uses it."
7/3/2015 13:59,55964945a9a36e1d46000eb9,B,"yeah, I've used r-studio but the plain interpreter is more fun on the whole. Only really done plotting with it so far, might try and use it in parallel with dataminer, see if it can match it functionwise."

7/3/2015 10:03,55965df2b30d843537000e68,C,"I just finished the assignment, it would have been helpful to still have access to the hints after you had it correct, several times I wanted to go back a reread a hint after getting father and I also would have liked to have access after I hit the done button, I had wanted to look at some of the stuff again, but no longer could."
7/3/2015 18:00,55965df2b30d843537000e68,C,"I'm sorry to hear that this design didn't work for you. This is part of the design of the CTAT tool we're using. We won't be able to modify this during the course, but I'll take this feedback back to the CTAT team for consideration."
7/6/2015 20:58,55965df2b30d843537000e68,C,"I'll add a +1 to this comment; I'd read it earlier but I didn't realise the extent to which I'd be locked out (I thought it was only the hints that were blocked out).  Having nothing but ""You have completed this assignment"" on the page with the assignment is especially problematic given that a few of the things we learned how to do in this assignment were *only available in the assignment* and not also in e.g. a handout or listing of typical operators or whatever.\n\nWhen you're giving them feedback: I'd say that it'd be semi-acceptable to show this in a ""frozen"" form (although it would be nice to have the hints too).  Then at least we'd be able to go back and check what we had done, check our answers if we need to reconstruct anything, etc, etc."
7/7/2015 18:48,55965df2b30d843537000e68,CQ,"So, I talked to the developers. Modifying the assignment design itself is not feasible in the short-term, but perhaps \nwe could provide access to the assignment outside of EdX so that you could do it again.\n\nWould this be helpful? I can't guarantee it, but I can ask about it..."

7/3/2015 16:23,55968f8db30d84c9b8000f83,B,the 5.3 comes from sourceforge and it's free. I'm using it since the tasks are based on that one.

7/3/2015 13:38,5596904fa9a36eea62000f3a,C,"I got both questions correct, only because I can do basic arithmetic. I have NO IDEA what the formula means. I don't know what Pknow or Numhints is. No explanation or context was provided. I'm feeling pretty frustrated at this point."
7/3/2015 13:54,5596904fa9a36eea62000f3a,C,"they're just introducing concepts at this stage (things like pnow is a variable, we'll probably have to start picking them out of research papers at some point) I think the questions are a heads up to anybody who's forgotten the order of arithmetic operators so you're way ahead!"
7/3/2015 15:10,5596904fa9a36eea62000f3a,C,"Yes, I think this is supposed to be just an example of the type of predictive equation (a.k.a. regressor) one might work with in this field. In this case, I believe the equation tries to predict the number of hints (""numhints"") a student will ask for when completing exercises in some sort of online tutorial. The exact nature of the inputs is unclear to me without a deeper understanding of the data set, but they appear to include the time the student spent on something, the number of actions the student used to do something, and this ""pknow"" variable that reflects the probability the student has mastered the skill. \n\nIf you know those three things, the equation allows you to predict the number of hints the student will request. But I would point out this is just a model that provides an expected value--no student will ask for exactly 13.58 hints, but the model suggests the number will probably be somewhat close to that for a student with that particular pknow value who used the specified number of actions and time. And the model is only as good as the data (the ""training label"") that went into it. It might or might not work for a different population of students or different learning content. And it might be useful only over a certain range of inputs. Unless the exercise is very long, requesting thirteen or more hints seems like a lot to me, so if this were based on a real data set, I might question what's happening there."
7/3/2015 18:04,5596904fa9a36eea62000f3a,C,"Eric -- exactly. We'll discuss where features come from and how to create them in week 3, and we'll discuss pknow in specific in week 5. For now, this is just an example. Can't cover everything at the same time!\n\nAnd, yes, usually 13 hints *is* excessive, but one sees data sets where students request 40 (even when there are only 4 to access! e.g. lots of rereading)."
7/6/2015 15:59,5596904fa9a36eea62000f3a,T,I'm a bit lost and feeling a bit frustrated as well. I am glad I'm not the only one.

7/4/2015 19:40,5596ef7ab30d840995000f6c,B,"I had the same problem of the window for installing the package freezing up.  I discovered that this window was on top of a window containing the GNU license agreement.  I slid the frozen window to the size, uncovering the window with the license agreement.  This window also had a button to install the package.  Clicking on that one worked.  All in all, seemed a little strange."
7/13/2015 18:32,5596ef7ab30d840995000f6c,B,"Hi! I am running RapidMiner in windows and I had exactly the same problem at the beginning. As Olden02 points out, what you have to do is simply to move your window to a side and then you will find the GNU license window where by clicking ""OK"" the add-in will start installing."

7/3/2015 22:52,5596f1f4a9a36e315a000ed0,S,"Hello Natalia\n\nI'm Fabio, from mexico. Computer Science Eng. \nNice to meet you, my desire is learn a lot of this course.\n\nGreetings!"
7/4/2015 10:41,5596f1f4a9a36e315a000ed0,P,Welcome to the class! I'm glad to have you here!\n
7/3/2015 21:12,5596fab9a9a36e7006000f9f,B,"When I first added the logistical regression, it reliably crashed the process by using too much memory.  The fix to that is to tell java to use more.  If you're a command-line user, run it as something like:\n\n`java -Xmx1G -jar lib/rapidminer.jar`\n\nFor me, 1GB seemed to be enough.\n\nNote that it's still super-slow, though.  One of the hints says it will take ""a little while"", but this is misleading—the decision trees had taken less than 30s, so I figured ""a little while"" would be a few minutes... but the process ended up taking  *46 minutes* to do the logistical regression, almost 100 times longer.  So, if your process seems to be taking a long time, that might be right. :)"
7/4/2015 10:41,5596fab9a9a36e7006000f9f,B,"Yup. If it's too slow, just go ahead and ""game the system"" to get the answer (e.g. click through the hints). Logistic regression is crazy slow in RM, unfortunately."
7/6/2015 13:13,5596fab9a9a36e7006000f9f,B,"Tried to increase the memory to 7GB using the command you provided. RM used, however, only 1.6GB which cut down calculation time with a whooping 3 minutes (from 42 to 39 minutes)... No idea why RM doesn't use all the assigned memory but it provides some improvement, although small."
7/8/2015 20:29,5596fab9a9a36e7006000f9f,B,"Thanks for the confirmation here - at 15 minutes in and RM still creaking along, I was concerned something was broken!"

7/3/2015 23:15,5597175fa9a36e5a76000f51,Q,"I am concerned about how safe it is to interpreting a linear regression model only by looking at its coefficients.\n\nI mean, for this equation in the Question,\n\nNumhints = 0.12 * Pknow + 0.932 * Time - 0.11 * Totalactions.\n\nIt's quite clear that Time has the largest impact because the coefficient has the largest absolute coefficient value. But what if a model is transformed? For example,\n\nNumhints = 0.12 * Pknow + 0.1 * (Pknow)^2\n\nCan we say that Pknow has more impact to (or more strongly correlated with) Numhints than (Pknow)^2 only because 0.12 > 0.1?"
7/4/2015 10:48,5597175fa9a36e5a76000f51,O,"Hi -- you're completely right. You can only interpret coefficients in terms of impact if the variables have the same scale. You can make that happen by unitizing the variables (we discuss this in week 3). \n\nAnd even still, impact is not the same as correlation.\nEven if a 0.1 difference in variable A changes the predicted variable\nmore than a 0.1 difference in variable B,\nvariable B could still be more strongly correlated to the predicted variable.\n\nWe'll discuss the meaning of correlation more thoroughly in week 2.\nAlso see https://sites.google.com/a/tc.columbia.edu/bakeredmlab/abcd/4122-BivariateData-v1.pptx"
7/6/2015 19:50,5597175fa9a36e5a76000f51,O,"The reason I found that question confusing as phrased was that it talked about the ""same scale"", but the sample data that we had been given had apparently not been unitised..."

There's a lot of debate about whether you want more folds (approaching leave-out-one-cross-validation, where every data point gets its own fold) or fewer. Not good consensus about this. I tend to think 2-fold or 3-fold doesn't end up with models representative enough of the full-data-set model; some folks argued strongly against leave-out-one about a decade ago, but the debate has swung back more recently. Bottom line -- it's arbitrary and probably everything 4 and up is basically fine."

7/6/2015 13:26,55991565b30d84445700108a,O,"Prediction modeling doesn't really get at causation. There's an alternate paradigm for trying to infer causation, causal data mining, which tries to identify characteristic patterns of covariance which are associated with causal relationships. It's powerful but remains a bit controversial. We'll talk about it in week 5."

I very serious about advancing Learning analytics in my classroom. I therefore consider Big Data and data-mining mandatory for my personal development. I would like my students to take ownership of their learning and give them insight into their own adaptive learning profiles and their interaction with courseware. How can we make courseware more adaptive? I think we'll need to analyse Big Data in Education to make this possible. Can we use this to enhance the students motivation?
7/6/2015 11:07,55998f02b30d8454c7000fe4,S,"Hi Adam,\n\nGood to see another Dutchman :) I totally agree with your views on Big Data. In fact, I would go even further and state that the current (science) curriculum teaches a lot of ""facts"" but hardly addresses the data analysis (of Big Data) itself. I believe that the times of the lonely scientist sitting at his laboratory bench and coming up with a brilliant hypothesis on the action of, e.g. a particular cell organelle, are largely over. Instead, we are bombarded with data that we cannot humanly analyze ""manually"".."

7/6/2015 13:35,5599d6beb30d84b8bb000fe6,B,R is more powerful and flexible and has a broader range of tools. It's also easier to mess up in (all those option flags) and packages vary considerably in quality and reliability.

I hope next sessions will help participants realize why they are doing what they are doing and the context of this. I did not get the idea behind using the different operators. This may be because I missed parts of the sessions because this is my first edX course or because I am not very familar with these statistical tests or the names Rapid Miner uses for them.\nI ll keep following and trying the resources; interesting course and tools."

7/6/2015 16:45,559ab0bda9a36eb142001102,Q,"Hello everyone, I have a few questions perhaps someone could answer as I try to apply the information from Week 1 to situations I have faced.\n\n1- How generally applicable are the operators we have used the first week of class?  Are the rules they are built upon specific to the point that the operators work for particular variables you may collect in an education setting to predict a particular label or can they be used for many research situations and data you may collect proved that the type of data in the CSV file matches the type of data the operator can read (binomial v. polynomial for example)?\n\n2- As an example, if one has a great deal of information on student use of a learning management system and wanted to determine if these (or which of these) are the best predictors of success in a class what would be the general steps one would follow to make sure that he/she picked the correct operators, set up RapidMiner correctly, etc.?  I have been able to follow the step-by-step directions in Week 1 fairly well, but don't know that I would understand where to start if I didn't have the guidance/hints.  I believe that if I were able to visualize the process with something I have been thinking about already, that I may better understand how the parts of Rapid Miner fit together to analyze the data.\n\n3- Quite a while ago when I was learning statistics I found it useful to have a statistics tree which asked questions about the type of comparison I wished to make and the type of data I had, and based on these answers helped guide toward the best statistical test to utilize.  Is there something similar for the operators in Rapid Miner?  There appear to be many of them and while Rapid Miner appears to have a description of each I was hoping for something that would guide me toward the best operator to choose based on what I am trying to accomplish and the nature of my variables.\n\nThanks!"
7/7/2015 19:09,559ab0bda9a36eb142001102,O,"Hi Ewerth. Good questions!\n\n1. I would say that different operators work for different data sets with different properties. Variable types are one aspect of this, but only one. Just to give one example, support vector machines work great for text mining but not so well for interaction data. Logistic regression is a great approach for longitudinal prediction; did not work so well on this data set. There is ""lore"" about what models work for which situations, but it's not so well demonstrated *why*. \n\n2. For any given problem, I'd say that the best approach is to look at previous papers attacking similar problems and see what has been successful. In this specific case, are you operationalizing ""success"" as a binary (succeed/not succeed) or as a quantitative variable (grade)? There's been a lot of work on similar problems to both of these... The general process we used in assignment 1 is an appropriate framework;  which operator to use is a more open question.\n\n3. There isn't really such a thing for this kind of problem. Not yet, anyways. We could get to the level of saying ""use a classifier"", but there are so many options. (and personally, I happen to be a bit of a skeptic as regards those trees, even in statistics. there are so many considerations...)"

But afaict, this number is purely an artifact of assigning each datum its own id.\n\nSo when we go to exclude attributes that are too specific to the current data and wouldn't apply more generally, why is UNIQUEID not part of that list?  If I exclude it, the kappa score goes down slightly (of course), but it seems like that's just saying that the score was artificially high before."
7/7/2015 19:46,559af257a9a36ee25a0010df,O,"You definitely should remove UNIQUEID, to create a valid model. If the assignment led you to keep it in, that was an oversight in our part."
7/7/2015 19:49,559af257a9a36ee25a0010df,O,The CTAT thing was accepting the kappa scores with UNIQUEID still in the model; I can't check to see if it *also* accepted the kappa values with UNIQUEID removed.  But the question prompts that talked about what to remove definitely didn't include UNIQUEID (and it wasn't even an option in the multiple-selection-multiple-choice question about which attributes to remove).

Having only an undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics, I must admit I am struggling quite a bit too!  If anyone locates any additional resources, especially outside of what is mentioned in class, lets please all share with each other.  The statistics, and especially rapidminer, are very in depth!"
7/7/2015 15:01,559b0bd9a9a36e4353001101,B,"here's another poor soul, let me give RapidMiner walkthrough item 24 another try tomorrow, too disappointed today after an enthousiastic start:-)"
7/7/2015 19:21,559b0bd9a9a36e4353001101,C,"David, Aubrey -- the goal is hopefully not to just crunch numbers. The CTAT assignment and Walkthrough are meant to be a complement to the more conceptual materials in the video lectures and in the Bazaar activity. If there's a specific topic you'd like more resources on, I'd be happy to make suggestions. One I can suggest off the bat is Witten & Frank's general textbook on data mining. \n\nPauline -- what issues are you having with RapidMiner walkthrough item 24?"
7/9/2015 11:44,559b0bd9a9a36e4353001101,C,"I guess I should be able to play with the Rapidminer tool after item 1-23, but I cann't, f.e. how can I add 'the variable student back in'? It suggests the data are about students, but when I open the data in Excel it's hard to say where the data are about anyway. And it suggests there is a variable named Student, but I donn't see any list of variable names in the Rapidminer model."
7/9/2015 13:33,559b0bd9a9a36e4353001101,C,"Depends on how you deleted the 'student' variable. If you unchecked it in ""Read CSV"", you need to go through that wizard again and re-check it. If you removed it using an operator, you need to go through that operator and uncheck it."
7/9/2015 14:16,559b0bd9a9a36e4353001101,C,"thanks Ryan, I guess I shouldn't use the SaoPedroetal file like suggested in item 5, but use the TeachersCollegeX file instead, which is about students."
7/10/2015 12:21,559b0bd9a9a36e4353001101,C,I think the walkthrough mentioned a variable that had been deleted from the data set. Sorry about that.
7/6/2015 23:19,559b0ce9b30d844457001197,CQ,"I just finished this assignment. I feel that I spent most of my time and effort learning to use RapidMiner. I am concerned however of my current knowledge base on the statistics and concepts that were presented in this assignment. Is it enough to be able to ""crunch"" the numbers and come up with the correct answers?\nI have had undergraduate and graduate course work in qualitative and quantitative research, inferential and multi-variate statistics, however; much of the coursework was over 25 years ago. I am very interested in the subject of education data mining. Should I be concerned at this point with regards to my existing (and very limited)knowledge of the concepts and terminology that was covered in this assignment.\nDavid Richer"
7/7/2015 13:15,559b0ce9b30d844457001197,C,"David,\n\nI've been in Ryan's class (in person) and know he likes to start with a summary overview of the content.  Hang in there another week and see if it improves.  I have a feeling this first week was to set up some context and vocab for us, and make sure we can all download rapid miner and follow directions.  More details and specific analysis coming in the future weeks!\n\nLeigh Ann"

There's a few thousand of us here so we should be able to make quick work of tidying them up.\n\nSo I pasted the transcripts into pages on the wiki.  Lectures 1.4 and 1.5 I edited semi-carefully while I watched the videos, but of course, it's a wiki, so if I missed some, please just jump in and fix them.  I'd already watched the first three and didn't want to spend much time on them, so they're only paragraph-broken for now, but again, if you see errors or think of some other way to improve them, jump in!\n\nOr, just read them.

7/7/2015 5:29,559b639ca9a36e7e59001157,Q,"The Godwinetal paper helped me understand how education data is collected and analyzed.   Did anyone else think of the following issues as they read the paper?\n\n1. Was time of day a control variable?  \n\nI didn't see this in the paper (see page 6).  The attention span of young students can change drastically before recess, snack and lunch, even when the teacher and topic are engaging.    Or for kindergarteners in a full-day program, the time after lunch can be difficult if the students are tired, or had a busy morning.  \n\n2. Teacher's classroom control\n\nI realize how difficult this would be to measure for this type of data analysis, but some teacher's have great control, and others don't (or there are good days and bad days in any classroom).   But this is such an important factor for keeping student's on task, of any grade.  \n\nI'm interested in what other's thought about the design of the experiment.\n\n\n\n"
7/7/2015 10:32,559b639ca9a36e7e59001157,O,"Yes, I think you're right. I'm working on some research design related to EDM/LA myself and got the advice to focus on certain contexts. Context related to type of students, type of teacher, type of pedagogical form et cetera. It is very hard (or even impossible) to use findings from just one or some contexts to make generalized conclusions about all of them. So always be careful with that."

I love that the GUI is so intuitive with boxes, strings, and buttons.  I had always been hesitant to get into programming because the long strings of symbols and data looked so foreboding.  Towards the end of my undergrad, I finally began to enjoy it and learn more, but this is one of the more intuitive GUI's I have seen for math programming.  I did however get stuck on one thing...  I was never able to get rapidminer to assist me with changing the data in the example where it was required.  I could not find any error popup until I ran the program, and there was no fix button as the problem suggested.  Did anyone else run into this problem, and if not how was the error and fix presented?"

I have put in considerable amount of hours so far into this course and have had to really dig in to make sense of a lot of terminologies introduced during the first week. It is definitely an intermediate level course and I find the concepts taught so far to be challenging yet very engaging. I think what finally got me into the groove is the Case Study lecture in week 1, which puts the course in perspective for me. Also, the CTAT assignment and Rapidminer walk through have made me understand the concepts better. I am glad now that I have chosen to take this course. \n\nI am from Pakistan and have a diverse background in computer science, math, marketing and the non-profit sector. I have over 7 years of experience in higher education working in varied capacities from university-industry linkages to student advising and recruitment. I have finally got around to pursue my long-standing passion of data sciences in the last 8-10 months. I have recently finished two courses on another online learning platform and am currently enrolled in a few others. \n\nThe courses I have finished so far are Data Scientist's intro course and R programming. I am also auditing the Analytics Edge course offered on edX and I think it is one of the best online  courses I have seen. I have become quite comfortable with R and I will be glad to assist anyone who needs help with the courses I have mentioned or in general with the related course work. I also look forward to contributing more in this forum and learn from a very diverse group of learners. Best of luck to all and happy learning."

7/9/2015 13:50,559e37bbb30d84000200138b,T,Bem vindo! Eu ensinei em Nottingham no passado. Com quem vc. esta estudando?
7/9/2015 10:11,559e48efb30d84b8bb00136f,Q,"Dear Course Leader,\n\nWhy would we ""accept"" a lower correlation in the field of ""Education"" than others like ""Science""?\n\nIs there any peculiar characteristics within the ""Education"" domain that we have to live with the situation?"
7/9/2015 11:38,559e48efb30d84b8bb00136f,O,"I think it might be related to doing measurements on, basically, human behavior which are inherently more difficult/uncertain and, as such, we put up with a lower correlation coefficient."
7/9/2015 13:52,559e48efb30d84b8bb00136f,O,"Yup, exactly, McCloud77. That said, I disagree with the contention that ""Education"" isn't ""Science"". Researchers also ""have to live with"" lower correlations in all domains involving human phenomena at a grain-size longer than 1 s.: psychology, sociology, political science, medicine..."
7/9/2015 20:14,559e48efb30d84b8bb00136f,O,"Haha, I did not mean to imply that Edcational Research is not Science just a Science that has to contend with ""imprecise""measurements."

7/9/2015 10:17,559e4a49a9a36e729100146f,Q,"Dear Course Leader,\n\nIs there any need to ""normalise"" RSME/MAD so as to ""dim out"" the effect of units (e.g. variables in units of kilometre vs variables in units of nanometers) whereby models can be compared on the same footing?"
7/9/2015 11:36,559e4a49a9a36e729100146f,O,For the purposes of the CTAT assignment you do not need to normalize.
7/9/2015 13:52,559e4a49a9a36e729100146f,Q,I don't actually know what it means to normalize RMSD or MAD... can you clarify?\n\nThanks\nRyan
7/9/2015 15:06,559e4a49a9a36e729100146f,O,"Dear Ryan,\n\nAllow me to elaborate in this way.  Assuming there are two models:\n\nModel 1 predicts speeds of athletes based on height of athletes (in meters) and distance (in meters) of the track they attempt.\n\nModel 2 predicts heartbeats of athletes based on diameter (in meters) of their artery.\n\nApparently the RMSE/MAD of Model 1 will be larger than that of Model 2 by orders of thousand or ten thousand.\n\nOne way to compare ""apple-to-apple"", I suppose, is to ""normalise"" the predictors by dividing the measurements by some mean standards (e.g. mean height of athletes in model one and mean diameter of artery in Model 2) so that we were able to compare ""like-to-like"" (i.e. which model results in smaller RMSE/MAD).\n\nTrust I clarify my enquiry."
7/10/2015 12:27,559e4a49a9a36e729100146f,O,"Oh, got it. Thanks for clarifying.\n\nFolks seldom do this. One totally could... but it's more common to compare models for different variables in terms of correlation, which has an interpretation that's more similar anyways. RMSE varies not just by overall scale, but by variance in the data, etc. Once you start thinking in terms of proportion of variance, it's more natural to use a metric designed to do that, e.g. correlation."
7/13/2015 5:27,559e4a49a9a36e729100146f,O,"Point taken, Ryan.  Noted with thanks.\n\nYou neatly pointed out some of the deficiencies of using RMSE/MAD to benchmark models.\n\nOne of the excitement I get from this course is not just about how to use tools such as RapidMinder or how to build models.  It's rather how to benchmark models conducive to the circumstances of the subject in question.\n\nCheers!"
7/13/2015 12:35,559e4a49a9a36e729100146f,O,"Exactly on, Bohemia2000. It's key to think about why we want to use a metric, and what it means. Powers argues for always using multiple metrics in order to really understand what's going on. I tend to be less of a fan of RMSE than many other folks, probably because I think that its meaning is less useful than its statistical properties. But note that many others disagree with me -- both Pardos and Pelanek have recently argued for RMSE for many EDM applications. (Pardos's paper was in a workshop last summer; Pelanek's paper was in the latest issue of JEDM). It's certainly a metric that many argue for."

Here's what I did to get the below mentioned result:\nI took the file ""...classifier-data-asgn2"" and used .5 threshold as per previous activities. I then took the data and the model prediction columns of ""Y"" and ""N"" and converted them to 1 for Y and 0 for N. (I assume all the rows in this sample are meant to be different students). Then I saved out to tab delimeted text file. Then I ran SimpleAPrime (from terminal on a mac) to get this:\nA' = 0.7264556045125841\nTrue Positives = 181526.0\nFalse Positives = 68353.0\n\nI tried entering ""0.73"" ""0.726"" etc, but no luck. \n\nI can keep trying to solve, but I've been messing with this for a while and wonder if there's something obviously wrong with what I've done.\n\nThanks for any advice.\nJoe"

7/10/2015 3:10,559f3795b30d849956001483,Q,"Hello -\n\nFor the CTAT assignment, why isn't the non cross-validation Kappa value be much higher--like the Kappa value in the walkthrough (0.933)? Since the W-J48 Decision Tree method did a ""prediction"" on the entire training set, shouldn't we expect a high Kappa?"
7/10/2015 13:06,559f3795b30d849956001483,O,"Generally, yes. It depends on how much signal there is. J48 is a fairly conservative algorithm, based on its pruning step, so it doesn't attempt to fit the tightest model it can. (And this helps avoid overfitting).\n\nNote that non-cross-validated kappa is still much higher than cross-validated kappa."

7/10/2015 20:40,55a016e6b30d847c6f0014bd,O,"With data mining, you don't have hypothesis: you just throw in the data and let the program look for patterns. ""Statistics"" (as used within a lot of researches) normally starts with hypothesis you want to test based on data you have. But I think one can argue that datamining is a kind of statistics, as this is quite a broad term.\n\nEconometrics is the application of statistics on economic and/or business data and relates to stuff like business analytics."

7/12/2015 11:08,55a016e6b30d847c6f0014bd,O,"Thanks for the great reply JHKnobbout. \nI might add that in some cases (feature engineering for prediction modeling), you have hypotheses, but you don't take them nearly as seriously as you do in traditional statistics. You use them to suggest directions rather than as something to try to disprove."
7/10/2015 19:04,55a0173eb30d849ac8001465,Q,"It is big enough for example, that differences in r² of 0.0019 routinely come up with statistically significant.\n\nWhat does this mean? Can you explain this? I have no background in statistics."
7/10/2015 21:07,55a0173eb30d849ac8001465,O,"The two principal players in determining whether r^2 is different from zero (or from another r^2) are: (a) magnitude of the difference, and (b) sample size (N: number of cases on which the r^2 is based).  With very large N, even trivially small r^2 differences can be statistically different from zero. This is one of the dangers of huge data sets...virtually every difference or relationship you look at becomes ""significant"" (statistically speaking).\n\nWhether the values are large enough to be considered of practical (or educational) significance is another matter."
7/12/2015 11:11,55a0173eb30d849ac8001465,O,"Great reply, dmorse.\n\nTo add a little\nr^2 is the amount of variance a model explains. So an r^2 of 0.0019 means that the model explains about 1 in 500 of the variance. Very hard to get much benefit from trying to change this."
7/15/2015 13:02,55a0173eb30d849ac8001465,Q,"I'm sure these answers are correct, but I still have no idea what this is about. What is r^2?"

So here you see that pknow, time, totalactions and maybe skill as well are predictor variables. The predicted variables which you have labels for is numhints, and you use those labels to try to build a model so then you can predict the value when you no longer have those labels. The basic idea of regression is to determine which features in which combination, can predict the numerical labels and numerical value.""\n\nI'm getting confused here with the term 'label'. Is numhints not the name of a variable? At what point will you no longer have that variable?\n\n"
7/10/2015 20:14,55a02364a9a36e66e80014fe,O,"The label is the feature you try to predict, given some other variables. The way I see it, you could use the data from a course in a certain year in order to predict outcomes in the next year. For example, when we learn from our datamining that the number of views on the course website and the time spend there can predict course failure, we monitor the students who show that particular behaviour and take some action like sending them an email.

7/13/2015 5:44,55a15949b30d845692001513,Q,"I'm sorry, perhaps it was I who was unclear...   I believe the **formula** for recall offered at the top of the hint (TP/(TP+FN) is CORRECT because it references FN (False Negatives), whereas in the following portion of the hint, there is no further reference to False Negatives.  As False Positives do not appear in the correct formula for Recall, both of the references to False Positives would seem to be irrelevant to this question... \n\nYes I believe that TP are relevant, and the hint makes that clear, so no problem with the ordering of ""TP"" and ""True Positives."" Whilst False Positives were relevant to the previous walk-through about Precision, there is no further reference to FN (False Negatives) in the hint about Recall.\n\nBecause the reference to FN (False Negatives?), which I believe <is> relevant to the calculation of Recall, is not followed up anywhere farther along in the hint, i was confused about what FN meant, and thought either the FN was a typo, or the references to False Positives were mis-placed, since i recalled the same dialog structure from the previous question.\n\nI got my answer marked correct by using FN, which matched the formula, but not the explanation... so that's why i raised the question.\n\nI really appreciate your interest, and again apologise if it is me that is just being thick on this occasion.  \n\nWhile CTAT is not especially pretty, at this point in its development, it **is** a very effective improvement on working through a step-by-step explanation in a text book and I really applaud your very Agile effort to get software into service as quickly as it is functional, so that everyone can benefit from the ensuing symbiotic evolution of use, vocabulary, process, thinking and functionality.  Opening a new feedback loop (and inspiring the inertia of engagement from intelligent users) is a kind of prime directive in Learning Science, and I appreciate your energy and vision in opening up the frontier.  I know it will get both prettier and more seamless, and that it will include branching, adaptation, differentation, etc... in due course.  Thank you."

7/13/2015 17:07,55a2c397a9a36e362d001603,B,"That's a good question. I'm not sure if it's possible. I never tried to do that myself.\n\nThere is a way to visualize your data in a plot. If you use your dataset as an output of the RapidMiner process, when looking at the data, there should be a radio button at the top called ""Plot View"" which allows you to visualize your data.\n\nI have no idea if there is a way to get a visualization showing a regression line. The regression model and the dataset are two different outputs in RapidMiner. I assume that, in order to get a visualization that includes the data and the regression line, you would need an operator that take both the data and the regression model as an input. I'm not that it exists."
7/15/2015 16:45,55a2c397a9a36e362d001603,B,"There are two extensions on the RapidMiner marketplace for R.  One is called R Extension and the other is called R Scripting(for RapidMiner 6.xx).  I don't think RapidMiner has the ability to plot what you want within itself, but with the extension you can use R to plot your model with the line.  I have not used the extension before but you can always take the long way around: take the model RapidMiner has given you and put it through the Write CSV function, read that CSV into R, and plot that data using the lm() function.  Hope that helps!"

You said to predict a label we calculate this functions and then use cut-off (Step Reg.) and P(m) (Logistic Reg.) to predict the value. But before that how did you find Y and m coefficients?
7/14/2015 10:16,55a3a513a9a36e700600170a,O,"In a specific data set, the coefficients used to weight the predictor variables will be determined by the data mining package. The goal is to best fit the training data (with some consideration given to over-fitting by some algorithms). There are a lot of different algorithms used to select these coefficients. In RapidMiner, by default, Step Regression coefficients will be set by Ridge Regression; a dot kernel is used by default for Logistic Regression using a Support Vector Machine package under the hood. (That's why Logistic Regression is so slow in RapidMiner, BTW). I hope this clarifies."

7/14/2015 10:19,55a3b561b30d845692001624,O,"Hi, Pauline. What I would recommend is connecting Logistic Regression exa to Apply Model unl rather than piping your first Set Role to Apply Model. That Nominal-to-Numerical is making your data not line up between the two versions of the data coming out of Set Role, and it's confusing Apply Model. I think that's the issue."

7/16/2015 10:17,55a6d5f2a9a36e88ff0018fc,O,"The difference is that the thing we want to predict (for engagement, for instance) often occurs at a grain-size that is coarser (longer in time) than manifesting in a single action.

Bazaar might also be made optional if technical issues persist. So work through the assignments for its own sake. Don't worry about the integration with the progress page. Also, it might help if you log into Bazaar at the times suggested on the assignment page. Probably increases your chances of finding someone there."

7/17/2015 7:51,55a8b3f4b30d848ec4001aae,Q,"I'm off to a late start here, but I have a question regarding Regression which is killing me (more of a theoretical exercise, though):\n\nsuppose I want to predict performance (on a numerical scale or binary pass/fail) on the subjects a student will attempt based on his/her grade history (maybe better adherent in a K-12 context). Would it be sane to try and find a regressor for each subject using all previously obtained grades as features? Wouldn't that become too troublesome (overfitting) or computer intensive around senior year? Is there a better approach to this problem?\n\nThanks, guys! And for the staff: congratulations for the course!"
7/20/2015 1:32,55a8b3f4b30d848ec4001aae,O,"Hi -- I think that this would be very feasible to do. The number of predictors is unlikely to be that big. That said, you'll probably get better success, less overfitting, if you organize the data in terms ""in subject, out of subject"" features for each subject. So you are predicting math from ""in math, not in math"" features. Just a thought."
7/17/2015 9:16,55a8c7eda9a36e4e4e001a18,T,"Dear Course Leader,\n\nThe discussion on Knowledge Engineering this week is thought provoking.\n\nIs Knowledge Engineering only peculiar to the study of learning behaviour or that it's application was generic that, like data mining, could be applied in other domain subjects like financial services modelling, weather forecasting, medical diagnosis, etc?\n\nIs there any proven ""methodology"" that knowledge engineers would use during their interview with the domain experts and then building the predictive model?"
7/18/2015 21:14,55a8c7eda9a36e4e4e001a18,T,"Knowledge engineering has been around for decades.  The 'good old days' hark back to at least the 1970s, when Stanford researchers created Dendral and MYCIN, knowledge-engineered ""expert systems"" in the days of AI (artificial intelligence). Barr & Feigenbaum's classic 3 volume set, Handbook of Artificial Intelligence (circa 1981), outlines many methods that appear in 'modern' data mining tactics (as well as some that do not).  KE has been applied in multiple domains.  It's intriguing that application to education, cognition, and learning are recent newcomers to the party."
7/20/2015 14:23,55a8c7eda9a36e4e4e001a18,T,"Nice comments and references, dmorse. As a quick comment, though, I wouldn't necessarily agree that education, cognition, and learning are newcomers to knowledge engineering. There was very early work by William Clancey, for example, on embedding MYCIN into an intelligent tutoring system, and later work within the SOAR and ACT-R architectures built heavily on the methods of knowledge engineering (although increasingly using the alternate term ""cognitive modeling""). Through the 2000s, Ken Koedinger's group and Kurt VanLehn's group used knowledge engineering methods to study cognition in different educational domains. My opinion is that KE methods have diminished a bit in prominence over the last decade in education and cognition, and that's due to a lot of factors, but they have an important place. I think it's essential to figure out where KE methods are most effective, where data mining methods are most effective, and how we can best hybridize them and use them in concert."

7/18/2015 15:24,55aa6f96b30d84a7e5001949,Q,"I am using Python to solve this question. Every time an entry ""BORED"" is found in the 5th column (indexing from 0), I add the ID (double_anon_userID) of the student to a set (no duplicates). I also have a running ID set. The length of the set resulting from subtracting these two sets should give me the number of students who were never bored, right? Can you see where I am going wrong?"
7/18/2015 17:18,55aa6f96b30d84a7e5001949,O,You have to take into account that a student may show up several times as either bored **or** not bored since among the 915 observations there are only 236 unique entries for the userID..
7/18/2015 19:19,55aa6f96b30d84a7e5001949,O,"The ID set which counts the users who were ""BORED"" already takes into account any user who was bored even once. This is then subtracted from the total ID set. Since the question asks for users who were not bored even once, the result should reflect this number, right?"
7/18/2015 20:07,55aa6f96b30d84a7e5001949,O,"If I understand correctly you are generating a set with unique identifiers of students who are bored.\n\nSuppose the number of observations for which ""bored"" is true equals 200 and the number of unique identifiers for this ""bored"" group is 100 (and the total number of observations is 800).\n\nThus, you have 600 observations for which ""bored"" is false but this is not necessarily the number of different students. In order to get that you would need to determine how many unique identifiers are present in this collection. From the original post, it appears that this is stored in the ""running ID set""?\n\nPerhaps, easier to iterate through the ""bored"" variable and store the ID of any student where bored = 0?\n\nIn addition, if you are comfortable with R, you can solve this problem with **tapply** in one line of code."
7/18/2015 21:23,55aa6f96b30d84a7e5001949,O,"The pivot table will give you the total number of ""boredom""; but I still had to count CAREFULLY in the table to get the number of bored students (unique ID)."
7/18/2015 21:53,55aa6f96b30d84a7e5001949,O,"A python set removes the duplicates. As a sanity check, I do get the total number of students as 236. Just the number bored as 151."
7/18/2015 21:54,55aa6f96b30d84a7e5001949,O,"A python set removes the duplicates, so I think I am covered for what you are saying. Thanks for trying to figure this out with me :P."
7/18/2015 22:01,55aa6f96b30d84a7e5001949,O,"If I count the number of unique IDs that correspond to bored = 0, there is no guarantee that they will not also appear bored in some cases. Since the question asks for students who were never bored I formulated it as total students - those who were bored at least once. It must be something super silly but I can't work it out :/."
7/18/2015 15:33,55aa71b1a9a36eea62001b39,Q,"I think this is a super interesting question. Ryan talks a lot about gaming and how students use hints in many of the lectures. This probably affected the way in which I interacted with the hints themselves. In general, I imagine that informing participants about the methodology of the research produces results closer to what is expected or is known to be true in theory. Does it though, skew the results? Should this be considered a factor while interpreting the results from say, this course?\n\nFor a simpler example, consider two prisoner's in a prisoner's dilemma setting being informed about the Nash Equilibrium outcome. Does this affect the way they make their decisions. Does it skew their decisions in favor of the Nash Equilibrium outcome? Either way, the results are bound to be different from the when the prisoners are left alone to make their decisions and has to be treated as a different case, right?\n\nPlease tell me I am not overthinking this :P."
7/18/2015 17:11,55aa71b1a9a36eea62001b39,O,"I would think that you would not inform the participants of a (behavioral) research study what you are trying to measure or how it is measured for that fact since participants might use that information to modify their responses and, in effect, render the measurements invalid. Except, of course, if you are designing a study which compares responses between groups where one group has been told that the observer (a person tallying keystrokes or a computer counting hint requests) will take note of particular behaviors. Most studies will probably not go that far because of the added time and cost associated with such a setup.\n"
7/18/2015 19:16,55aa71b1a9a36eea62001b39,Q,"Of course. But if you were analyzing the data from this course say, you will have to consider it right? Or does the effect somehow diminish when aggregating."
7/18/2015 19:59,55aa71b1a9a36eea62001b39,O,"If a student in this course is aware that the number of hints is counted it might influence his or her behavior although it most certainly would depend on the student itself. Since there are no real ""consequences"" of getting hints, i.e., the student's grade does not get lowered by a percentage for each hint, some students may decide to ""game"" the system while others may be more determined not to get any hints and a whole bunch of other students falling somewhere in between. If this data is to be used, the fact that students knew that hints were captured as measurements should be taken into account if it is to be correlated with some other behavior/outcome."
7/18/2015 21:56,55aa71b1a9a36eea62001b39,O,"That's what I was inclined to believe as well. All that remains to be answered is, has it been studied yet? Thanks for working through this with me :D."
7/20/2015 14:26,55aa71b1a9a36eea62001b39,O,"There's been research on observer effects, both from live observers and cameras. And students definitely do adapt their behavior based on the belief that the instructor is watching their online logged behavior, see work by Julita Vassileva.\n\nI'm not familiar with work exactly along the lines you're discussing, though."
7/21/2015 3:40,55aa71b1a9a36eea62001b39,P,Thanks for the lead!
7/18/2015 21:17,55aac254b30d840f2c001c5b,Q,"Working from my answer to 3.5, the number of actions is reduced by about 10% when the action-rich observations are dropped.  The number of observations decreased by two.  This should give answer of 2.1x.  But this doesn't seem to be the correct.  What am I missing?  And why can't I go to the next problem until all the previous problems are correct?"
7/19/2015 22:50,55aac254b30d840f2c001c5b,O,Finally got the answer.  Apparently one of us was not rounding correctly.
7/19/2015 0:26,55aaeeb0a9a36e4353001acf,Q,"So, teachers spend a lot of time managing off-task behaviour. And the ""residual"" off-task behaviour becomes non-significant in terms of predicting whether the student eventually goes to college. Wouldn't this be explained by the fact that the teachers are being effective?  Just imaging if they did not control very well the off-task behaviour -- and the class becomes run-away;  I've had classes like that (and teachers like that!)\n\nSo, perhaps there is an additional variable to consider : ""teacher effectiveness at keeping a lid on off-task behaviour"".  Arethere already some research results along those lines?"
7/19/2015 14:44,55aaeeb0a9a36e4353001acf,O,"I can so agree with your statement that an effective teacher will manage his or her classroom to the extent that off-task behavior is minimized (speaking from experience). That being said, I do not believe that off-task behavior should always be zero. A lot of significant interactions (student-student and student-teacher) occur during ""off-task"" behavior which may actually help the student in becoming a more effective learner and help the teacher in understanding his or her students better. As such, I think that off-task behavior should be defined very clearly and very narrowly if it is to  be of any importance."
7/21/2015 5:25,55aaeeb0a9a36e4353001acf,O,"I agree to all of these thoughts: The main problem is to define ""off-task"" very rigidly so that it covers only those interactions that take students away from the task further and further thus constantly reducing their chance to ever participate meaningfully again. But that was the way I understood the original comment, i.e. that only certain types of behaviour like gaming-the-system are the ones we want to avoid."

7/20/2015 14:27,55ab7cb9a9a36e66e8001b55,P,Welcome to the class! I'm glad to have you here!
7/19/2015 17:14,55abdb0fb30d840f2c001cc8,Q,"I understand why you should delete studentid, but doesn't uniqueid have the same effect?"
7/20/2015 14:29,55abdb0fb30d840f2c001cc8,O,Yup. Check previous thread. This was a bug -- it should have been deleted too.
7/19/2015 18:42,55abef8db30d84b8bb001b16,Q,What is the difference between the role ‘label’ and the role ‘prediction’?
7/20/2015 0:27,55abef8db30d84b8bb001b16,O,"The label is when you know what the answer is -- it's the known answer.\nThe prediction is what the model thinks the answer is.\n\nSometimes a data point can have both a label AND a prediction.\n(For example, when you're trying to see if the predictions are any good)."
7/20/2015 14:03,55abef8db30d84b8bb001b16,Q,"In the operator Set Role, you can assign the role 'prediction' to an attribute. \nIs this what you're describing here?\nWhy would you assign this role to an attribute? \nAre you creating an attribute that does not yet exist in the dataset on which the model is applied? (e.g. predicting which pupils will attend college in the future)"
7/20/2015 14:31,55abef8db30d84b8bb001b16,O,"I've never assigned ""prediction"" to an attribute using SetRole. I guess you would do it to test a model created by a different package. Normally in RapidMiner, the ""prediction"" role is set by ApplyModel -- which it would do if you used ApplyModel in RapidMiner to create an attribute that doesn't exist yet. I hope this clarifies."
7/19/2015 18:44,55abf01cb30d84bdd2001bb5,Q,"In step 2 we are applying the model on the same data from which we derived the model to check the performance. I understand that this is not a sound performance-check.\n\nBut in step 3 (with cross-validation) we take a part of the dataset and create a model. Afterwards we cross-validate this with the remaining data. This process is repeated k-times (k being the amount of partitions made).\nIs the model that is being created k-times not different every time, since the data is different every time? Is the model correcting itself each time?\nWhy is a model more correct if it is based on a smaller amount of data? Is it not better to use al the data you have to make your model?\n"
7/19/2015 20:56,55abf01cb30d84bdd2001bb5,O,"Suppose you want to test the validity of your model developed from some training data you would need to know the outcome of the dependent variable on another set of data which cannot be used in the development of your model. In order to circumvent this problem, we can split the training data in, say, five groups, develop our model with four groups and test it on the remaining fifth part of the training data using different combinations each time. Hopefully, taking different training sets (parts of the overall training set) each time circumvents the problem of testing the developed model on the sum total of the training model. Of course, when your training set is very small this approach would not work very efficiently.\n\nEDIT: http://docs.rapidminer.com/studio/operators/modeling/classification_and_regression/lazy_modeling/k_nn.html"
7/20/2015 14:33,55abf01cb30d84bdd2001bb5,O,"Agreed. If the data set is really small, you're unlikely to get a great model out of it no matter what. The validation will show you that."
7/21/2015 15:16,55abf01cb30d84bdd2001bb5,O,"To add on McCloud77 answers, the cross-validation process gives you an idea of how well your model will generalize to new data, but it doesn't affect the way the model is created.\n\nIf you compare the final models you obtain with and without cross-validation, you can see that they are actually the same. Even when you are using the cross-validation operator, the final model is the one built on all the data.\n\nThe cross-validation helps you try to figure out ""what would happen if I took my model and apply it to new data?""\nYou repeat the process k times because repeating the process helps ensure that you didn't get your result by random chance. There is not something specific to your testing data that makes the model run particularly well (or particularly badly). By running multiple test it gives you a better idea of how your model will behave, overall, when you apply it to new data."

7/19/2015 19:01,55abf3f3a9a36ecf41001b8c,Q,"Which algorithm do I use for kNN? \nI found W-CitationKNN, but this generates an error:\n""Incorrect Multi-Instance format, must be 'bag-id, bag, class'!""\n\nIs this the wrong algorithm or am I implementing it incorrectly?"
7/20/2015 14:34,55abf3f3a9a36ecf41001b8c,O,Wrong algorithm. Use k-NN. (no W)
7/21/2015 15:10,55abf3f3a9a36ecf41001b8c,O,"To add to Ryan's answer, RapidMiner offers an implementation of kNN (using the ""k-NN) operator. The W-CitationKNN is a different operator that was added when you installed the weka extension (all operators coming from the weka extension starts with ""W-"")"
7/19/2015 22:54,55ac2abfb30d8454c7001aab,Q,"As I read Problem 3.8, it is asking for the average of the maximum times for each of the five problems the student was observed attempting.  Is this the correct interpretation?"
7/20/2015 6:21,55ac2abfb30d8454c7001aab,O,"Yup. Of course, the average of a maximum value is that maximum value :)"
7/20/2015 14:35,55ac2abfb30d8454c7001aab,O,"Yup. As another thread mentioned, we have a typo (a wordo, I guess). We're trying to get it fixed. Sorry for the confusion."
7/20/2015 15:47,55ac2abfb30d8454c7001aab,Q,"To me an ""average"" means at least two values are present, which is not the case since there is only one maximum value.  Confusing it is.  Thanks for the responses!"
7/21/2015 12:58,55ac2abfb30d8454c7001aab,O,Yup. It was just that I wrote the incorrect word. It should be fixed now. Sorry for the confusion.
7/21/2015 14:59,55ac2abfb30d8454c7001aab,Q,"Why would one use PivotTable on this problem when a mere two data sorts, one on each dataset, gets one to the answer?"

I felt a bit like a space monkey piecing together analyses following the walk-through (which by the way was extremely helpful) but not understanding deeply what I actually am doing. \nHowever, I'm looking forward to week 2 which will probably address some of the questions I have and will fill in the missing links using something like ""Stastics for Dummies"".\n\nThanks for putting the course together\nPaul"

(I only respond where I feel like I have something useful to say though :-)\n\nI understand how you feel -- this course is not really targeted towards beginners; it's designed to match (more or less) the graduate course I teach at Teachers College Columbia University, so it does assume some background knowledge.\n\nYou might find it more useful to start with a more general stats or data science course, or with the more introductory course on this same topic, Data, Analytics, and Learning (DALMOOC).

In the last step (step 4) of the import configuration wizard, you will see a table containing all of the attributes. For each attributes, you will have a pair of drop down boxes.

Through our unique advising and admissions products, we help more than 12 million students around the globe identify their strengths, explore careers, create academic plans, find the right college match and complete college successfully. We partner with more than 10,000 schools, colleges, and universities to better prepare students for success.""  Some of our products that you might be familiar with include Naviance (K-12), Radius (higher ed), Connect (higher ed), and Starfish (higher ed).\n\nIn my role, I conduct both internal and external research on college and career readiness throughout formal schooling experiences--including primary and secondary school and higher education. For internal research, I explore the effectiveness of Hobsons' various platform education solutions. For external research, I partner with associations and foundations to conduct research to better the education field's practices for preparing students for both college and career.\n\nI work with large datasets with over 1 million record points utilizing R, Excel (with macros), and SPSS programming (with macros) for descriptive and inferential statistics and data mining. I also use basic MySQL for database queries.\n\n \n\n**Academics & Research**\n\nI am working on my Ph.D. in human development and quantitative methodology (Links to an external site.) at the University of Maryland, College Park.  To this end, I am also part of the Motivation in Education Research Group (MERG) (Links to an external site.), under the direction of Professor Allan Wigfield.  Right now I am working on my dissertation, in which I am exploring how students' perceptions of emotional support from teachers relates to academic motivation (ability beliefs and values) in math and reading and academic grades from 2nd grade through 12th grade.\n\nMore generally, within the fields of developmental and educational psychology, my research explores how social relationships, especially those with teachers, influence academic motivation and achievement in various domains, including math, science, and reading, from the beginning to the end of formal schooling.  My newest area of interest is exploring how educational technologies influence teacher-student relationships and student motivation and learning.  \n\n \n\n**Why this edX?**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I have become interested in ""ed tech"" and how such technologies influence student motivation and outcomes.  I started my foray into this area about a year ago, and I have learned a great deal since I started working at Hobsons.  In addition, I consider myself to be an aspiring education data scientist, and I would like to continue to grow my skills in this area.  I was informed of this course through the Education Data Science BOOC at Indiana University."

Skill A is being able to add two 1 digit numbers (for example, 1 + 2 = 3) and skill B is being able to determine whether a variable is continuous or binominal. Those two skills are completely independent, it wouldn't make sense to compute one overall initial knowledge, one overall learning rate, etc"
7/23/2015 18:44,55b00207a9a36ea584001df2,B,"Alternatively, for people who do not want to modify the code it might be possible to simply separate the data file in two and run the code twice. Be careful though, 1) I haven't tested this to make sure it gives the same result (but I don't see any reason why it wouldn't), and 2) be sure to not separate the data from the same skill across different files (all rows associated to the same skill should remain in the same file)"
7/24/2015 14:05,55b00207a9a36ea584001df2,B,"I was thinking they would be independent models as well. Based on this, I think Question 10 might need to be a little more specific. It asks for P(G) for VALUING-CAT-FEATURES (all of the skills) instead of one specific skill e.g. META-VALUING-CAT-FEATURES1. Does that make sense?"
7/25/2015 23:14,55b00207a9a36ea584001df2,O,"Hi Bob, VALUING-CAT-FEATURES is the skill, not a set of skills.\nThe item column represents individual items (well... actually, it represents problem steps. the true items would be the problem plus the ""item"" here, and you don't have the problem in this data set). So you should built the BKT code to fit VALUING-CAT-FEATURES, and the other skills in that column, not META-VALUING-CAT-FEATURES1 and the problem steps (called ""item"" here somewhat inaccurately). \n\nFitting items makes more sense in other paradigms like PFA.\n\nI hope this clarifies; if not, let's discuss more."

7/23/2015 14:07,55b0f53db30d84c9b8001f44,Q,What is the difference between a Decision Tree and Decision Rules? Aren't they essentially portraying the same concept? Isn't a tree a graphical representation of a rule?
7/23/2015 18:29,55b0f53db30d84c9b8001f44,O,"Hey,\n\nThere are differences between decision trees and decision rules. As described Data Mining, practical machine learning tools and techniques (Witten,ea, 2011) differences can, in many cases, be made in two ways: \n\n* representation: clarity, the representation in rules can make the learned more self evident. This can be particularly true when there are replicated subtrees (for example at the root you have A, here it branches in B en C, B branches in D and E, C branches in X and Y after which X branches in D and E - I admit with a graph this much more clear but I hope you see the repetition of D and E below B and X. A part of the tree is repeating). Especially in these cases rules can be more easily understood than large decision trees.\n* In a multiclass case, a decision tree takes all classes in account trying to maximize the the information gained from a split while a rule-generating  method concentrates on one class at a time (not taking in account what happens to the other classes).\n\nIt is possible to generate decision rules from decision trees. In rapidminer you can use the Tree to Rules operator. I don't have any experience in using this operator. \n\nAlso this presentation: http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~son/datamining/DM/6-rules.pdf can be of interest to you.\n\nHope this helps. Any comments, additions are more then welcome.\n\nKind regards."
7/24/2015 15:21,55b0f53db30d84c9b8001f44,O,"I agree with all of this. Also, as a practical matter, most decision rule algorithms (like JRip) end up with a relatively more simplified structure (for instance, JRip is like a J48 decision tree where the left branch is always a leaf). As such, they tend to be a bit more conservative."

E.g., my score of 0.5/1.0 became 1.0/1.0 after I revisited Assignment 4 and clicked the Done button.

7/27/2015 14:29,55b6405ba9a36e32370020ee,Q,"I'm confused why you say that BKT only uses the 1st problem attempt at each item, and that it therefore throws out lots of data.  In the example you went through, weren't there 2 problem attempts?  In your example, I understood that before the student did anything, the p(L) = .4, but that after he typed in the correct error the probably he already knew it was p(L) =.2, and then you discussed the probability he knew it BEFORE the 2nd attempt at the problem (.28).  Then in the next row of data you discussed the probability the student already had the knowledge given that on his 2ND ATTEMPT, he got the correct answer…p(L) = .58.  So, why do you say Bayesian only considers the first attempt of each problem?  If the student had gotten it wrong the 2nd time instead of correct, couldn't you have continued to estimate the probability he knew it given it was now wrong, and continue to do that over and over until he got it right?  Please let me know what I’m missing!"

Since we filtered (instead of deleting) rows that didn't have ""VALUING-CAT-FEATURES"" as the KC, the formulas as listed were not correct because the row values down the left side are not ""1, 2, 3.."" they are the filtered values of ""21590, 21596, 21612..."" and the formulas will not work as shown in the hints area.  For example, it says to place values in (column)2, which does not exist in this filtered data.  When you attempt to enter the formulas as directed by the help module, you are referencing cells several thousand places up, and propagating this error through the rest of the column.  If anyone is having difficulty, consider referencing the row that you are working off of or checking to see if we were supposed to return to the original data set and not this filtered one, since it doesn't make sense to reference another student's behavior thousands of places ago.  Unless I missed something of course, which happens sometimes."

As McCloud77 says, the problem 1 hint sequence indicates that it is necessary to copy the data to a new spreadsheet. If you do that, I don't see how you end up with the error you are indicating; that's only possible if you don't quite do what problem 1 or its hint sequence states. I hope this clarifies?

8/5/2015 19:59,55c26b10b30d847c6f002a0d,Q,"hi,\n\nhow can i do if i can for compile information about more institutions. can i mix all this data in one only data base?\nwhat do you say me about this..\nthank you"
8/6/2015 21:35,55c26b10b30d847c6f002a0d,Q,i'm not sure i understand the question -- are you talking about integrating incompatible data into one database? or size issues?\n\nyou might take a look at the PAR framework or National Student Clearinghouse's efforts along these lines?
8/5/2015 20:57,55c278b2a9a36e88ff002a95,Q,"Should we calculate confidence for sequential rule behavior-ontask ? affect-concentrating student by student and average the result, or maybe we should calculate it on the whole dataset (using the definition of division of appropriate support values)?"
8/7/2015 2:25,55c278b2a9a36e88ff002a95,O,"Hi, I think your question is:\n\n * Should I calculate confidence separately for each student, and then average the student-level support values\nOR\n * Should I calculate confidence on each pair of {time N, time N+1} actions\n\nIf this is your question, the answer is \n* calculate confidence on each pair of {time N, time N+1} actions\n\nI hope this helps."
8/7/2015 15:41,55c278b2a9a36e88ff002a95,O,"I've tried several times and have yet to get the correct answer.  I have noted that confidence is (# of data points that fit the rule)/(# of data points that fit the ""if"" condition).  To get the numerator, am I looking for situations where the first observation(N) ""behavior-ontask"" is 1 and the second observation (N+1) ""affect-concentrating"" is 1 also then continuing this for observation N+1 to N+2, etc. OR in order for the condition to be met does N ""behavior-ontask"" need to be 1 and in the N+1 observation ""behavior-offtask"" and ""affect-frustrated"" be 0 before ""affect-concentrating"" is 1?  I hope this makes sense.  I guess in general I am asking if all that matters is whether in one observation the student is on task and the next observation he/she is concentrating or if the student cannot be off-task or bored in the second observation before concentrating is noted.\n\nFor the denominator it would appear that the ""if"" condition would be the number of observations where ""behavior-ontask"" is 1 unless I am mistaken.\n\nThanks for the insight!"
8/8/2015 1:32,55c278b2a9a36e88ff002a95,Q,"I am similarly having trouble with this question. I calculated this across the whole dataset, using the count of cases where behavior-ontask was recorded, divided by cases where behavior-ontask is immediately followed by affect-concentrating. Is this not correct?"
8/10/2015 15:43,55c278b2a9a36e88ff002a95,O,"EmilyK019, Ewerth -- that's not quite correct. If behavior-ontask is the last observation for the student, it's not possible to have anything after it, so it doesn't count for the denominator.\n\nDoes this clarify?\n\nSorry BTW for slow response."
8/17/2015 17:00,55c278b2a9a36e88ff002a95,P,"Thanks for the response! I was on vacation.. but I'll try this again soon to see if I can get the correct answer.\n\nBest,\nEmily"

8/25/2015 8:50,55c3000ca9a36e5e21002b9f,O,"You can set up models to look at this either way. In this case we were looking for only one step into the future, but it's possible to configure the algorithm to look an arbitrary number of steps (including looking at the whole future).\n\nTypically for affect, it varies enough over time that researchers and practitioners aren't interested further than one step into the future.

8/7/2015 21:05,55c50a07a9a36e3237002c3e,O,Awesome. Thanks for the response. I finally figured it out. But I don't understand. I included all of the affect-concentrating values in my total when calculating the probability of affect-concentrating values. Shouldn't I only include the values that could possibly be preceded by a behavior-ontask value?
8/8/2015 6:05,55c50a07a9a36e3237002c3e,O,"Yes, for P(affect.concentrating=1) it would appear logical to only include those observations that can be preceded by a behavior.ontask value which would exclude the first observation for any student. This would be similar to P(behavior.ontask =1) where you do not include the last observation.\n\nIt would appear that the value calculated for the confidence may thus be ""accidentally"" correct since the calculation for the lift in question 10 based on the calculated values for the confidence and (P(affect.concentrating =1) using the previous values gives the incorrect answer.\n\nI did try to re-calculate P(affect.concentrating=1) without the preceding observations but that does not work either."

8/10/2015 9:34,55c50a07a9a36e3237002c3e,P,Thanks. I'll try again tonight.
8/10/2015 20:43,55c50a07a9a36e3237002c3e,T,Still no joy.
8/10/2015 23:43,55c50a07a9a36e3237002c3e,O,"casm - here's a better explanation of what I did.\n\np(A&B) = number of times sequence occurs, excluding final observations/total number of observations (yes, do not subtract anything from the total)\np(A) = number of times A (behavior-ontask) occurs (subtract out the last value for every student)/total number of observations\nP(B) = number of times B (affect-concentrating) occurs (don't subtract out the first or last value for each student)/total number of observations"
8/11/2015 10:19,55c50a07a9a36e3237002c3e,O,"bodily11 is correct; that is the correct answer.\n\nAs for whether that should be the correct answer,\nit's actually kind of tricky. A mathematical formula\nlike cosine that seems obvious hides a lot of implementational\ndetails, and different packages handle this differently.\nThat's one of the many reasons why different data mining packages\nproduce different answers.\n\nI can see how the other answers made sense here --\neven how they can be seen as making more sense.\n\nSo I'll give the ""official"" answer away on this one: 0.671\n\nThanks for your hard work and effort on this problem."
8/11/2015 10:22,55c50a07a9a36e3237002c3e,O,I'll ask the CTAT team to modify the problem so it also accepts 0.704.\nMight take a couple days though.
8/7/2015 21:44,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,Q,"This question should be simple.\n\nWe calculated Confidence in Q8. We calculated Cosine in Q9. In Q10 we only have to calculate the Lift. \n\nLift = Confidence / pr(B).\n\nWe already calculated Confidence, and we used pr(B) in our calculation for Q9. So we should be able to use those same values to get the correct answer. However, it doesn't work. I'm wondering if I am doing something wrong or if the answer was keyed incorrectly.\n\nThanks."
8/8/2015 10:22,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,Q,Depends on the values you put in right?.. I mixed things up a bit and got a wrong answer as well - guess that's the concept of 'slip' as prof. Baker explained before..\n\nYour formula is right but what did you exactly calculated?
8/8/2015 11:18,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,O,"I agree with you. we have the partial results already calculated so it must be straight forward. \n\nAnyway, althought there were no instructions to group by student, just in case, I did so but the result is still wrong."
8/8/2015 18:48,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,O,I calculated p(B) by two ways\n1) p(B) = total number of observations with affect-conc==1 divided by total number of observations;\n2) p(B) = (total number of observations with affect-conc==1 excluding first observation for each student) divided by (total number of observations excluding first observation for each student).\nBoth results are wrong.
8/8/2015 19:10,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,O,Just to see if we are all on the same page...\n\nThe total number of rules is 658.\n\nThe total number of the sequential rule beh.ontask => aff.conc is 308.\n\nThe total number for beh.ontask = 1 is 424.\n\nThe total number for aff.conc = 1 is 452.
8/9/2015 7:33,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,O,"The numbers are the same but result ""(308/424)/(452/658)"" is wrong."
8/9/2015 7:38,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,T,"Yep, cannot for the life of me get the correct lift.."
8/10/2015 0:16,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,O,"I guess we can not treat behavior_ontask(A) and affect_concentrate(B) equally in Q7-Q10.If A->B is a casual relationship, then A and B are not equivalent. If this assumption holds, then we do not have to exclude the first observation of a student when counting the number of B. Lets say today is raining, and the ground will be wet tomorrow (the opposite does not hold). and we observe the weather From day 1 to day 7 (a week). If the ground is wet on day 1, then we should include it,since the result does happen, but if it is raining on day 7, we shall lose the chance to observe the ground is wet or not, since the observation period is over. \nExcuse me for my far-fetched explanation."
8/10/2015 6:23,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,O,"As I wrote I used both variants to calculate P(B). For Q9 the first one is worked but for Q10 ""red answer"" is in both cases\n\n1)The total number of rules is 713.\n\nThe total number for aff.conc = 1 is 497.\n\n2) The total number of rules is 658.\n\nThe total number for aff.conc = 1 is 452."
8/10/2015 6:50,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,O,"I don't think that the number of total observations for either beh.ontask or aff.conc should be a different number depending on the questions. There are only 658 sequential rules where beh.ontask=>aff.conc. Think of it as modifying the data set in such a way that, for every student, the last observation for beh.ontask and the first observation for aff.conc are deleted resulting in a data set where (for each student) the beh.ontask and aff.conc. are now on the same row.\n\nConceptually, this is the data set from which to calculate the respective probabilities (PA&B), P(A), and P(B)"
8/10/2015 12:31,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,O,"I was having this issues too but found out where I was going wrong.\nWhen calculating the probabilities you loose a sample, but each probably looses a different sample e.g. A looses the last sample and A^B looses the first sample.\n\n    +--------+-----------------+----------------------+---+-----+\n    | obsnum | behavior-ontask | affect-concentrating | A | A^B |\n    +--------+-----------------+----------------------+---+-----+\n    |   1    |        1        |           1          | 1 |     |\n    |   2    |        1        |           1          | 1 |  1  |\n    |   3    |        0        |           0          | 0 |  0  |\n    |   4    |        1        |           1          |   |  0  |\n    +--------+-----------------+----------------------+---+-----+\n\nThink this is another way of putting what McCloud77 said.\n"
8/10/2015 20:23,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,O,"When calculating this in R, I found the easiest thing was to displace affect.concentrating up by one, dropping the first observation (e.g. obsnum 1 of affect.concentraing above). Next I dropped the final observation from each student (e.g. obsnum 4 of behavior.ontask). Now comparisons are on the same row, which are easier to loop through.\n\nI got exactly the same figures as McCloud77 above for each of the different elements. However, I am still unable to pass the grader to 3 sig. figs.\n\nAaaaaarrrgggghhh!"
8/10/2015 20:42,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,O,"Also tried in Excel, with exactly the same results."
8/10/2015 21:47,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,O,"Apparently, when calculating the lift one has to use the total number of observations where affect.concentrating is true (irrespective of student) and divide that by the total number of sequential transactions (taking into account the student id).\n\nWhen dividing the confidence by this probability, the correct lift appears.\n\nBut I do not understand the rationale behind this."
8/10/2015 23:31,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,O,"You are a champion! I tried all of the different combinations I could think of, but I guess I didn't try that one. That worked for me.\n\nHowever, I don't understand the rationale behind it either..."
8/11/2015 0:32,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,O,"I'm also puzzled.\n\nThe numerator and the denominator of that probability refer to different underlying data sets (full vs exclusions per student) - something needs to be looked at closely.\n\nI tried all sorts of combinations, and this odd one never occured to me.\nI'm on the same page as the post above by McCloud77 followed by SSergei.\n\nThis makes a fairly big difference in % - and the possible size of the difference can get quite large when there is a small number of transactions per student. And by large, I mean large enough that some may cross some magic threshold .... like may appear in the next question in CTAT.\n\nSo ... Q9, Q10 and Q11 all need some scrutiny."
8/11/2015 5:38,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,P,"Thanks, you did it!"
8/11/2015 6:54,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,O,"Well done. I'll have to have a deep think about this one, as I don't feel that I am yet clear about divisors.

8/11/2015 10:28,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,O,"Hi guys. Nice job puzzling it out. I honestly didn't mean to make this so painful. We'll think really hard about how to make these clearer next time around. The issue of whether these interestingness metrics should use the contingent probability of B or the absolute probability of B is a real question, and one (of many) issues that different packages handle differently, I think.\n\nI apologize for making it so painful. \nClearly these problems should have had hints. I don't know why they were omitted."
8/11/2015 20:49,55c526d7a9a36e86bc002c5d,T,A great example of the wisdom of crowds. Thanks to all who contributed to the discussions so we could all finally get there.

8/7/2015 22:37,55c53333a9a36ea584002c55,Q,"Hello\n\nI've completed week 1 assignment today and I could not figure out from the lectures how the knn algorithm works.\nFirst, I saw that not using cross-validation results in kappa=1. I understand that if we don't use cross validation, the closest point is the point itself. I think that training in these conditions results in k=1 so that's why kappa=1.\nNow, I'd like to know what is changed when we use cross validation or how does cross validation change the training so we obtain other k?\n"
8/11/2015 20:06,55c53333a9a36ea584002c55,O,"With cross-validation where k=1, you're using the one nearest neighbor. But with cross-validation, the data point you're trying to predict is excluded. So the prediction changed, because you're no longer using a point to predict itself, you're using its nearest neighbor besides itself."

8/8/2015 17:37,55c634ddb30d8463fc0030ad,B,"You could use the arules package to mine the dataset for rules but we are already given the rule to investigate, namely, behavior.ontask=>affect.concentrating. In fact, Excel could be used as well to calculate the number of students for which the rule holds at least once, etc."

8/8/2015 17:06,55c63708b30d843e96002bb2,O,"I guess there is a mis-concept period during the error rate increasing part. This may happens a lot in this case: when students have to make a decision or a choice, they are facing multiple different paths. Among these paths, only a few but not all are the right ones to get the finally correct answer. So the students are actually trying to exclude the wrong ones (or mis-concepts) just by pick up one to go and see if it is right. If it is not right, then they will rewind to choose another option, and keep trying like this, until they get to know exactly what the right concept is. This is very probably when students can not get useful help or the help is not informative."
8/8/2015 17:16,55c63708b30d843e96002bb2,O,"For example, mis-concept may lead to the right answer once a while, but not always. So as long as the number of questions increases, the mis-concept behind the right answer will reveal its original truth: which means that the students understand the concept in a fake way, or they do not really understand the concept in a right way."
8/8/2015 19:06,55c65318b30d84b8bb002bdd,O,"The educational institute I’m working for provided a dataset with >50,000 data points regarding student grades from the last ten years. This is from all departments and all courses given over that period of time. The main question is whether achievements in certain courses within the department of IT studies (Mathematics, Introduction to Databases, Java1 et cetera) can predict fail or success of one specific course (Database development).\n\nNow I’m a bit struggling what techniques to apply. As we try to predict a binary outcome (fail vs success), we should go for some kind of classifier. But there are many variations and I’m not sure which route to take. Is a logistic regression classifier a logical option, or does a decision tree like J48 makes more sense? I found several papers doing related work, their however seem to just go for this or that technique without really explaining why. Or is it a matter of just trying multiple techniques and look for the best results, as done by [Baker et al. (2015)][1]?\n\nAnother question: how to decide how much data point to use for training our model? Is there some rule-of-thump for the amount of data to use for training and testing?\n\nFinally, we have a specific question in mind and we build a model around that very question. But the data can of course be used for other interesting analysis as well. Unfortunately, due to privacy I can’t publish the dataset. I can, however, explain what is in it. It contains the student ID, the degree they follow, the courses these students have taken, the grades they got for these courses, the number of attempts made to a course and, for all variables mentioned, the date the course was started/exam was taken. All suggestions for additional analysis are welcome!\n\nHope to hear the opinion from my fellow educational data-miners :)\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.columbia.edu/~rsb2162/2015paper41.pdf"
8/9/2015 18:00,55c65318b30d84b8bb002bdd,O,"With regards to subsetting your dataset into training and test sets, you could choose 70/30 or, if you have a lot of observations, 60/40.\n\nLogistic regression is probably OK to do as a first step if you take into account collinearity and you may want to do some initial visualizations to see how variables are distributed, if you can see any apparent trends in the data, etc.\n\nThe greatest challenge will be to decide how to use your variables, i.e., a combination of some variables may give you a better predictor than just the variables by themselves. On the other hand, some variables may need to be removed; it all depends if you want to include them, and if it makes sense to include them, in your model.\n\nAfter you have decided which variables to use, it might be beneficial to run a random forest model; without actually having seen the data it is extremely difficult to make any judgments with regards to which models to use.\n\nLooks like an interesting problem though :)"
8/10/2015 20:31,55c65318b30d84b8bb002bdd,O,"Hi. I agree,  it's an interesting problem. You may find it useful to look at Dekker et al 2009 (with Pechenizkiy). There's been other work since then; I can't remember it off the top of my head, but look in google scholar at who cites that paper.\n\nI think that Logistic Regression is a reasonable choice. Given the sparsity in your data set, and the presence of a lot of binaries (i realize it can include how many times the student took each course, but it's mostly binaries, support vector machines might work pretty well (I usually don't recommend it, but for this problem, maybe...). J48 might overfit, but it's worth trying. In general, I don't think it hurts to try a few things. Not 500 things, that would risk overfitting. :-)\n\nA 70/30 split is reasonable, but I would recommend cross-validation more strongly. It uses all your data more systematically, and is likely to estimate eventual later performance better."
8/11/2015 13:05,55c65318b30d84b8bb002bdd,T,"Thank you for your replies gentlemen! Looks like we kinda think in the same directions, which is a good thing. Will look into the Dekker et al. paper (Predicting Students Drop Out: A Case Study). As they are from a Dutch university as well it makes sense to uses a simular approach, for the educational system is the same."

8/12/2015 4:35,55cac920a9a36ebe32002e5e,T,"Hi there.\n\nI am currently working as an e-learning developer. My background is chemistry and I am doing grad school part time in theoretical chemistry. Therefore, I am interested in physics, chemistry, math, and education. In theoretical chemistry, statistical mechanics plays an important role. Earlier, I found a book with title, Statistical Mechanics of Learning by A. Engel and C. Van den Broeck, in which a lot of concepts and theories borrowed from statistical mechanics are applied in machine learning in relation to evaluating the progress of students in their learning. An example is generalization error which Prof. Ryan Baker introduced in week 6 (Power Law of learning curve). The book goes more in-depth into the power law of learning curve. Although I can understand the statistical mechanics part of the book, I find it difficult to relate concepts from physics to education. Are there any bridging materials between these two fields for beginners? Thank you very much and I'd love to learn these two areas in a more unified manner."
8/13/2015 9:57,55cac920a9a36ebe32002e5e,T,"Huh -- I haven't heard of that book. I'll have to pick it up, it sounds very interesting! \n\nI'm not aware of any bridging materials. The number of people who have made the transition from Physics to EDM remains pretty small -- although there are some superstars like Dave Pritchard and Brett van de Sande. It's a great idea to create this, though. I hear that lots of companies are hiring physicists to do EDM..."
8/14/2015 1:15,55cac920a9a36ebe32002e5e,T,"This is very interesting. I have a PhD in particle physics and I currently teach high school Calculus at a prep school, on hiatus from research until the family grows up a little.  I want to resume my research career in education rather than physics, and I too am very interested in bridging the gap between quantitative science methods and social sciences.  Particles are a lot more predictable than humans, and we require 5-sigma effects before publishing!  The methods, the ethics, the collection and analysis of data with students as the data source is all very exciting and new to me.  I'll check out this book on Statistical Mechanics.  It sounds relatable! :-)  Thanks again for the suggestion. Please pass along any other resources you come across. \n\nProf. Baker - what companies would those be that are hiring physicists?  I know ""data science"" is where most of my former colleagues ended up, but I don't know of many that are education-related.  Thanks!"
8/16/2015 11:17,55cac920a9a36ebe32002e5e,T,"Hmmmm. I'm pretty sure that Pearson and McGraw-Hill's analytics teams have hired former physicists recently. A lot of smaller companies probably would too, if they had the opportunity. Best way to find out about opportunities is probably to attend EDM or LAK conferences. Second best way is to sign up for the listserv edm-announce (google it); a lot of jobs get posted there. Good luck, and welcome to the field!"
8/18/2015 3:08,55cac920a9a36ebe32002e5e,P,"Thank you very much for your reply, Prof. Baker! I think it is an approach to EDM from the perspective of physics. :D"

You should only see the first question, that's by design, the next one will show after you answer the previous one correctly.

You mentioned that skill should be tightly defined. I understand that 'arithmetic' will be too broad, but what would be an appropriate level of detail? Would 'subtracting' do? Or rather 'subtracting three digit numbers'? I'm asking this, because I experience the same struggle when formulating learning objectives: If a learning objective is too broadly defined, it's hard to determine whether the learning objective has been reached. If you go into too much depth, you end up with too many learning objectives to draw proper conclusions. Does BKT have this risk?\n\n2. I'm not sure I'm interpreting the P(G)<0.5 and P(S)<0.5 correctly. I would think that P(G)=0.5 would mean that the probability of guessing is as great as flipping a coin, but that doesn't like a very promising model..."
8/21/2015 11:40,55d250d8d7c4e3c75600000b,O,"Hi, As10. No problem for posting late; I'm responding late! Got a little overloaded.\n\nTo answer your questions.\n\nI think that *subtracting* will typically be too broad. Work by VanLehn for example has showed that there are a lot of component cognitive skills in subtraction, and 15-3 is fundamentally easier than 15-8, say. Subtraction-with-carrying involves more cognitive steps than subtraction-without-carrying.\n\nThe kind of issue you're talking about -- what should the skill mapping be -- is discussed in lectures 7.6 and 7.7. But knowing what grain-size you want your skills to be at, and having an initial mapping, before using EDM to refine it, typically works better (and produces more interpretable results) than going fully bottom-up. \nMethods like cognitive modeling can help you figure out what the right grain-size is likely to be. A bit outside the scope of this class, but see work by Koedinger as well as VanLehn\n\n2. If P(G)>0.5, it means that ""If you don't know it, you still have a probability of guessing that's like flipping a coin"". I call that ""model degeneracy"" in some papers (Beck disagrees, he thinks P(G)+P(S)>1 is required for a degenerate model). But to me, I agree -- if you can get it right more often than flipping a coin when you don't even know the skill, something is wrong. \n\nBeck's argument is that if P(G)=0.51 and P(S)=0.01\nThen the probability of getting it right is still higher if you know it than if you don't know it, so you can tell the two apart over time. And he's right, but still, if not knowing something leads to getting it right, something is wacky."

But I got 100% for the 5th assignement and the 64% are for the 6th assignment.\n\nDo you know how to fix it ? Do I have to send you a screenshot ?\n\nThanks a lot\n\nCoraline"
8/21/2015 11:46,55d602d101772bf07a0001c7,B,"Hi, have you checked the other threads regarding issues with CTAT? Maybe the solutions that worked for other students (regarding cookie settings) could help you as well."
8/20/2015 16:45,55d6043e01772b83ae000199,Q,"I am using Matlab to program to calculate, when i go with the statement of the question, the Matlab script gets the answer: 0. I do not think i can understand what the question means, not even a little. And did not even understand the hints after reading them through. Can anyone help me? Will someone think the answer is 150? What does ""poster A actually responds directly to poster B "" mean? Does this ""actually"" mean this post is initially started by B? or something like that?"
8/20/2015 19:25,55d6043e01772b83ae000199,O,"After following the hints step by step, i can only get 113. By the ""concatenate"" function, i understand that the designer would like to make up pairs of posts. However, there are only 150 pairs of posts, would it be possible that the correct answer is far beyond than that? And there is no sign that the posts at the same thread are excluded. Can someone help me to clarify that?"
8/21/2015 8:45,55d6043e01772b83ae000199,Q,"I calculated the pairs of posters in Excel. There are also 113 but we have to exclude 3 pairs with the same from- and to- posters (posts number 93, 165, 187). It means no more then 110 connections. I checked all numbers from 0 to 110 but no one is ""green"". Can somebody clarify the solution?"
8/21/2015 11:23,55d6043e01772b83ae000199,O,I also checked the case when posters are connected if both posted in the same thread. It is wrong too.
8/21/2015 11:52,55d6043e01772b83ae000199,O,"I agree with you folks, the current answer is impossible. Sorry, this was my error somehow. I'll get it fixed ASAP."
8/21/2015 11:54,55d6043e01772b83ae000199,O,SSergei's answer was correct. Sending bug report to development team now. (It was my fault not theirs)
8/21/2015 12:01,55d6043e01772b83ae000199,O,"Problem 3 suffers from the same bug. Feel free to either race past it, or to wait a day or so for the tech fix. Sorry for the inconvenience."

8/21/2015 9:23,55d6ee0901772b425e00026a,Q,"I used Rapidminer as described in the assignment, found two attributes which have big differences between cluster0 and cluster1, so all seems well. But what does this difference mean?  Or, more fundamental, what do the values mean? Are they coordinates, the amount of data point in the cluster et cetera? I really am curious about this, as it looks like an important step in the process, for we use it to select the most relevant attributes. Hope somebody can explain one of two things. Cheers!"
8/21/2015 12:03,55d6ee0901772b425e00026a,Q,"Hi -- I'm not sure I understand your question. When you say \n""what do the values mean"", are you asking what the points represent?"
8/25/2015 10:35,55d6ee0901772b425e00026a,O,"I guess they are one and the same yes. So I'm refering to the results of the first question, where we have to analyse which attributes have the biggest difference. E.g. what does a value of 892.503 for attribute A represents (see screenshot below)?\n\n![7.1 output][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14404987034720922.png"
8/27/2015 7:45,55d6ee0901772b425e00026a,O,"These are the coordinates of the centroids of each cluster. \nSo cluster 0 is centered at [892.503, 513.662, 544.192, 461.702, 473.589, 866.709]. If you compare this to cluster 1, you note that there's a big difference between the centroids for attributes a and f, so those are the features that differentiate between clusters 0 and 1."
8/28/2015 12:48,55d6ee0901772b425e00026a,P,"Alright, that's clear. Thank you for your reply!"

8/21/2015 21:20,55d7961301772b38df0002b2,Q,"I presume this means the equivalent of a complete graph with connections between all nodes. Wikipedia has some useful diagrams on this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph\n\nFrom this it seems that a complete graph should have n*(n-1)/2 connections.\n\nHowever, this seems to give the wrong answer."
8/22/2015 5:20,55d7961301772b38df0002b2,O,Don't forget that you will need to identify how many unique posters there are first..
8/22/2015 6:27,55d7961301772b38df0002b2,T,Duh! Silly me. Take-home message: read the instructions.

I also finished the Baazar activity (I only communicated with VirtualRyan since no one else was online).  While this incorrect grade won't impact my final grade, I want to mention this. \n\nDo the Baazar activities have any impact on the overall grade?"
8/25/2015 17:55,55d9124d01772b2feb00034e,B,I went through and redid the problems and now the bar is showing up correctly.\n
8/25/2015 1:17,55dbc20e01772b1b0c0004d5,Q,"When I get to Step 21 of the RapidMiner Walkthrough, I don't get the result screen with kappa, but rather a repeat of the W-J48 result obtained earlier.  This despite multiple attempts and following the instructions exactly.  Any thoughts?"
8/25/2015 8:54,55dbc20e01772b1b0c0004d5,O,"Hi, it might be your outputs going to the right side of either the cross-valiation or the overall process aren't set up right. Can you put up a screenshot?"
8/25/2015 2:50,55dbd7ee01772bf4e40004b4,Q,Where does one find the graph(s)?  Not in the 4K text file.
8/25/2015 8:54,55dbd7ee01772bf4e40004b4,O,"The text file creates an implicit graph which could be visualized with a graph-drawing program of your choice (posters are connected to each other through threads, e.g. posters = nodes, threads = links)"
8/25/2015 13:02,55dbd7ee01772bf4e40004b4,T,Any suggestions.  Excel is all I have available.

8/26/2015 15:05,55ddd5b39714b0798b000732,CQ,"Professor Baker, \n\nWhat time does the course close today?  I thought that you had previously posted it was open until a certain UTC time today which I may have mistakenly thought was until around 8pm EST.  After 2 weeks of travel, I had cleared my calendar to complete the course today, but when I logged in, it said the course was already being tallied?  Did I miss the boat for completing the course today?\n\nThanks for any clarification you can provide!"
8/26/2015 19:52,55ddd5b39714b0798b000732,CQ,I also would like to know if I can submit an assignment this afternoon. \n\nThanks!

8/30/2015 14:02,55e30cfd9714b033eb000ad1,Q,"I've some data on discussion forum use within a virtual learning environment. I extracted four variables:\n\n 1. Student ID;\n 2. Number of comments made by individual students;\n 3. The average length of comments (i.e. wordcount);\n 4. Percentage new post vs replies (#new/[#new + #replies])\n\nI now cluster students based on these variables, using Rapidminer. However, how can I see why certain students are put in certain clusters? I think (or at least hope) that students with only a few comments, short messages and high percentage of new posts are put in one group but I don't quite see how I can verify this. Tried a scatterplot but this of course lacks one dimension (see screenshot below). Any tips where and how I can obtain this information?\n\nMoreover, would it be useful to transform the numerical variables into ordinal ones? For example, make two groups on the percentage of new posts vs replies (Posters vs repliers). I think this might make the task of determining the number of clusters k slightly more easy, or do I make some n00b mistake here?..\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14409433155942176.png"
